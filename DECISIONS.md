**Last Updated**: October 13, 2025  
**Status**: Pre-Development / Scaffolding Phase

---

## üéØ Core Product Decisions

### Vision & Positioning
- **Problem Solved**: Unstructured BJJ progression + psychological barriers (fear of "stupid questions", mental blocks, lack of feedback loop)
- **Unique Value Prop**: AI coach that addresses BOTH technical AND mental game aspects
- **Target Market**: White to Purple belt practitioners training 2-4x/week
- **Core Differentiator**: Skill Tree visualization + psychological coaching (not just a tracker)

### Pricing & Monetization
- **Model**: Freemium subscription
- **Free Trial**: 1 week full access (email signup only)
- **Viral Hook**: Tweet about app ‚Üí get 1 extra free week
- **Paid Tier**: $9.99/month or 3-month discounted bundle
- **Unit Economics**: 
  - AI cost: ~$0.30/user/month
  - Net profit: ~$8.60/user/month (86% margin)
  - Breakeven: 3 paying users

### Scope Philosophy
- **MVP Timeline**: 6-8 weeks (solo developer with AI assistance)
- **North Star Principle**: Ship functional over perfect
- **Feature Gating**: Validate core hypothesis (consistent logging) before adding advanced features

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture Decisions

### Tech Stack (Final)

| Category | Technology | Rationale | Alternatives Rejected |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Framework** | Next.js 14+ (App Router) | Industry standard, great DX, built-in API routes | Remix (smaller ecosystem) |
| **Language** | TypeScript (strict mode) | Type safety across full stack | JavaScript (too risky for data integrity) |
| **API Layer** | Next.js API Routes | Simpler, more flexible, easier to debug | tRPC (locks into TS ecosystem, overkill for MVP) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 15+ | Complex relational queries for Skill Tree, pgvector support | MongoDB (poor for relational analytics) |
| **ORM** | Prisma | Best-in-class migrations, type generation | Drizzle (less mature), Raw SQL (too manual) |
| **Validation** | Zod | Runtime type safety, works with Prisma, validates LLM outputs | Yup (less TS integration) |
| **Auth** | Clerk | Easier setup than Auth.js, good free tier | Auth.js (more config), Supabase Auth (vendor lock-in) |
| **UI Framework** | shadcn/ui + Radix UI | Accessible, customizable, modern | MUI (bloated), Chakra (less momentum) |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Rapid prototyping, easy dark mode | Vanilla CSS (too slow), Styled Components (runtime cost) |
| **Charts** | Recharts | Simple API, good docs | Chart.js (less React-friendly), D3 (overkill for MVP) |
| **LLM Provider** | OpenAI (GPT-4o-mini) | Best cost/performance ratio ($0.15/$0.60 per 1M tokens) | Claude (more expensive), Gemini (less reliable) |
| **Voice** | Whisper API | Accurate for BJJ terminology ($0.006/min) | Web Speech API (poor accuracy for technical terms) |

### Infrastructure Decisions

| Component | Solution | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Hosting (MVP)** | VPS + Coolify | Low cost, full control, easy Docker deploys |
| **Migration Path** | Frontend ‚Üí Vercel (when scaling) | Keep DB on VPS, offload edge compute |
| **DB Backups** | Daily pg_dump + S3/Backblaze B2 | $0.005/GB/month, 7-day retention |
| **Monitoring** | PostHog (analytics) + Sentry (errors) | Both have generous free tiers |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions + Coolify webhooks | Auto-deploy on push to main |
| **SSL** | Let's Encrypt (via Coolify) | Free, auto-renewal |

## üé® UX/UI Decisions

### Information Architecture

**Bottom Navigation (4 tabs):**
1. **üó®Ô∏è Chat** - Primary interface (Musashi conversation + logging)
2. **üìä Game** - Skill visualization (Skill Tree, submission stats, position analysis)
3. **üìà Progress** - Consistency tracking (calendar, streaks, cardio/energy trends)
4. **üë§ Profile** - Settings, goals, subscription management

**Rationale**: Separates "What I'm good/bad at" (Game) from "Am I training enough?" (Progress)

### Interaction Design Principles
- **Logging Speed**: Must take <60 seconds per session
- **Chat Response Length**: Max 2-3 sentences unless user requests detail
- **Quick-Select First**: Buttons before free text input
- **Visual Feedback**: Charts/graphs inline in chat (not just text)
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Show simple stats first, details on tap

### Chat Flow Innovation
**Embedded Action Buttons** (not popups):
```
Musashi: "Did you train today?"
[Yes, rolled ü•ã] [Yes, drilling] [No, rest day]

Musashi: "How was your cardio?"
[üî• Great] [üòä Good] [üòê Average] [üòì Gassed]
```

**Rationale**: Natural conversation flow + one-tap responses = low friction

## üß† AI Agent Decisions

### Persona: "Musashi"
- **Blend of**: Danaher (precision) + Rickson (philosophy) + Saulo (systematics)
- **Tone**: Calm, specific, analytical, encouraging (never patronizing)
- **Adaptation**: Detail level scales with belt rank
- **Constraints**: No medical advice, no content outside whitelist

### Context Management (MVP)
- **Strategy**: Retrieve last 3-5 sessions as JSON from Postgres
- **Format**: `{ date, techniques, mood, energy, coach_feedback }`
- **Token Budget**: ~500 tokens context per message
- **Phase 1.5 Upgrade**: pgvector semantic search for relevant past insights

### Rate Limiting
| Tier | Limit | Cost Impact |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Free Trial | 20 messages/week | $0.02/week |
| Paid | 100 messages/week | $0.10/week |

**Rationale**: Feels generous for normal use, prevents abuse

## üìä Data Model Decisions

### Skill Tree Taxonomy (MVP)
**Simplified Structure**:
- 5 Domains (Guard, Passing, Top Control, Escapes, Takedowns)
- 20 Positions (Closed Guard, Mount, Half Guard, etc.)
- 50 Techniques (Armbar, Triangle, RNC, etc.)
- Allow "Other" with free text for edge cases

**Expansion Path**: Crowdsource improvements post-launch, multi-node mappings in Phase 2

### Content Strategy
**MVP**: Hardcoded seed data
- 50 curated YouTube links ‚Üí techniques
- Markdown files for mindset/philosophy content
- Whitelist: Danaher, Lachlan Giles, Bernardo Faria, Gordon Ryan

**Phase 2**: MCP-powered dynamic search
- Agent searches YouTube via MCP
- Filters by approved channel whitelist
- Returns top 3 results per technique

**Affiliate Links**:
- BJJ Fanatics (10-15% commission)
- Disclose affiliate status in agent responses

---

## üîí Security & Privacy Decisions

### Data Protection
- All user data encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest (Postgres encryption)
- Session data (mood, energy, mental state) treated as sensitive
- GDPR/CCPA compliance: data export + account deletion features

### Safety Rails
- **Medical Disclaimer**: "I'm a training assistant, not a doctor. For injuries, see a professional."
- **Mental Health Boundaries**: If serious issues detected, refer to therapist
- **Content Moderation**: Agent cannot recommend unvetted sources

## ‚ùì Open Questions & Future Decisions

### To Be Resolved
- [ ] **Domain name**: TBD (needed for SSL setup)
- [ ] **Color scheme**: Dark mode vs light? Calm/zen vs intense/competitive?
- [ ] **Onboarding length**: 5 questions vs 10? (User to decide)
- [ ] **Weekly summary timing**: Sunday night vs Monday morning?
- [ ] **Free tier restrictions**: Can view old data but not log new, or hard cutoff?

### Deferred to Phase 2+
- Mobile app (React Native vs PWA-only)
- Internationalization (Spanish for Brazilian users?)
- Coach white-label platform architecture
- Video analysis (computer vision for technique recognition)

## üîÑ Decision Revision Process

When reconsidering a decision:
1. Document the **trigger** (user feedback, technical blocker, cost issue)
2. List **alternatives** with pros/cons
3. Run a **small test** if possible (spike, user interview)
4. Update this doc with **new decision + rationale**
5. Mark old decision as `~~DEPRECATED~~`
