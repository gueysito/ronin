## Missing Content Strategy

**If you can't find a good free video for a technique**, what should Musashi do?

**Option A**: Suggest a drill prescription (text-based) instead of a video  
**Option B**: Recommend a paid instructional (BJJ Fanatics affiliate link) in Phase 2  
**Option C**: Skip recommendation entirely

**Your Preference**: [Choose one]

**Example Drill Prescription** (if no video available):
```
Technique: Omoplata from Closed Guard

Drill Prescription:
"Here's a simple omoplata drill:
1. Start in closed guard with your partner postured up
2. Control their right wrist with your left hand
3. Swing your right leg over their shoulder
4. Hip out to the left and turn belly-down
5. Sit up and grab their belt
6. Repeat 10 times each side before sparring

Focus on the hip movement—that's the key."
```

## Content Updates & Maintenance

Videos get deleted, channels get banned, links break. How should we handle this?

**Your Strategy**:
- [ ] Monthly review of all links (check for 404s, removed videos)
- [ ] User can flag "broken link" or "unhelpful video"
- [ ] Admin (you) reviews flags and replaces bad links

**Responsibility**: [Who maintains this post-launch? You, or delegate to community later?]

---

## Affiliate Links (Phase 2)

In the future, when Musashi recommends paid content (BJJ Fanatics, Keenan Online, etc.), should we:

- [ ] **Option A**: Only recommend if user explicitly asks for advanced content
- [ ] **Option B**: Recommend premium content alongside free links (e.g., "For a deeper dive, check out Danaher's Enter the System [affiliate link]")
- [ ] **Option C**: Never recommend paid content (keep it pure)

**Your Decision**: [Choose one and explain rationale]

---

## Video Recommendations by Belt Level

Should some videos be restricted by belt level?

Example:
- White belts see fundamentals-only videos
- Purple+ belts see advanced concepts (berimbolos, leg locks, etc.)

**Your Decision**:
- [ ] Yes, filter by belt level
- [ ] No, show all videos but label them (e.g., "Advanced - Purple+")
- [ ] Let user decide (show all, trust them to skip advanced stuff)

**Rationale**: [Explain]

---
